        <h2>Moist and delicious banana bread recipe. Easy to make!</h2>
        <p>The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do just fine with 3/4 of a cup, and many are happy with a 1/2 cup.</p>
        <p>You can toss in a cup of chopped nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips if you want, or put the batter into muffin tins and make banana nut muffins instead. You can even go a step further and make chocolate banana bread.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten </li>
            <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
